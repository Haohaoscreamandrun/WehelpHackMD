CloudFront achieves this by caching content at edge locations around the world, which reduces the distance data needs to travel, thus speeding up delivery and improving user experience.
    - CloudFront is designed to be easy for developers to set up and integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 for origin storage, and AWS Lambda@Edge for running code closer to users

## [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-overview/)(week1)

1. Docker is an open-source containerization platform that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of applications by packaging them and their dependencies into containers. Containers are lightweight, stand-alone, and executable units that include everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
2. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's installed on the host. You can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.
